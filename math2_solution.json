Then analyse the root cause and finally try to provide a repair suggestions to fix the buggy.\nNote that the bug can be fixed by modifying only the given buggy code; do not attempt to modify the class, add new functions, or conduct further testing.\n\n1. Buggy Function: \n/**\n* {@inheritDoc}\n*\n* For population size {@code N}, number of successes {@code m}, and sample\n* size {@code n}, the mean is {@code n * m / N}.\n*/\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    return (double) (getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize();\n}\n\n2. Trigger Test: \n    public void testMath1021() {\n\n        final int N = 43130568;\n\n        final int m = 42976365;\n\n        final int n = 50;\n\n        final HypergeometricDistribution dist = new HypergeometricDistribution(N, m, n);\n\n\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {\n\n            final int sample = dist.sample();\n\n            Assert.assertTrue(\"sample=\" + sample, 0 <= sample);\n\n            Assert.assertTrue(\"sample=\" + sample, sample <= n);\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n\n3.

Provide multiple distinct and detailed patch suggestions for resolving this bug.\nYou suggestions should be in the format 'Suggestion 1: {suggestion title}\\n{detailed description}', etc.",
    "solutions": [
      "Root Cause: The error message shows that the sample value is negative, which is not expected as per the test conditions set in the for loop.\n\nSuggestion 1: Update the sample value check in the for loop\nChange the condition in the for loop to check if sample is less than or equal to n instead of just equal to n. This will ensure that the sample value is within the expected range.\n\n```java\nfor (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {\n    final int sample = dist.sample();\n    Assert.assertTrue(\"sample=\" + sample, 0 <= sample);\n    Assert.assertTrue(\"sample=\" + sample, sample <= n);\n}\n```\n\nSuggestion 2: Modify the calculation in the getNumericalMean method\nUpdate the calculation in the getNumericalMean method to handle cases where the Population Size is 0. Add a check to return 0 if the Population Size is 0 to avoid division by zero.\n\n```java\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    int populationSize = getPopulationSize();\n    if(populationSize == 0){\n        return 0.0;\n    }\n    return (double) (getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) populationSize;\n}\n```"
